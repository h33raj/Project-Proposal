% *** Authors should verify (and, if needed, correct) their LaTeX system  ***
% *** with the testflow diagnostic prior to trusting their LaTeX platform ***

% The testflow support page is at:
% http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/testflow/



% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
\usepackage{blindtext, graphicx}
% Add the compsoc option for Computer Society conferences.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

In this proposal, We investigate the extent of device fingerprinting possible in Tor browser via the different JavaScript API. We even examine how much perlavent are the older fingerprinting technique. We will also examine all the Javascript API's for finding new fingerprinting technique. We will try to produce a unique hash with the help of these results which will help the users to track without the help of cookies. We will be analyzing the Tor browser bug trac issues and some side channel attacks. After the end of the research we will come with add-on which will defend with the privacy issues in firefox. We will also propose our idea on how the defence can be made to defend this issue for Tor browser.

\section{Introduction}
Web advertisers and analytic collect large volume of data based on our Internet browsing pattern. These type of data help them to make user profile which eventually reveals your user location, incomes, family status, interests and much about you. Identification of user can lead to showing higher prices, blocking some services or data and even directing to misleading information.

Most of the users to defend tracking usually delete their cookies but the tracking technologies are much evolved practice of deleting cookies have become less effective to users who is defending using deleting cookies. Many defencing tactics have been evolved in the recent years such as 'incognito' mode or private browsing, use of VPN or IP masking techniques, use of extensions and adds-on such as Ghostery, Disconnect, HTTPS everywhere etc.

But most of the defensive technique fail if the advertiser use the method of fingerprinting. Browser fingerprinting is a technique of uniquely identifying the individual user by the unique pattern of information collected which often includes browser type and version, operating system and version, screen resolution, font detection, plugins, time zones, languages, battery usage, hardware configurations and many more.

More that 2 Million of daily users use anonymous services such as Tor to defend client's privacy from his destination. Tor communicated through multiple number of relays using numerous number of encryptions such that none of the relays will be revealed the client's identity and destination. But still the advertisers can still cause privacy issues by using Browser fingerprinting.Tor browser has done series of patches to enhanse their privacy, they are using a component Tor button which takes care of Application level security and privacy concerns in Firefox. To protect against Tor exit Node eavesdropper, it includes HTTPS-Everywhere and to protect from optional defense against javascript and other potential exploit vectors using NoScript.

Tor browser doesn't support some APIs such as Battery API, Network Connection API and plugins such as Flash. Fingerprinting techniques like Font Fingerprinting are defended by disabling all the attempts to enumerate the system font by limiting the number of fonts in the system. Moreover the image data from the canvas is returned blank to defend against canvas Fingerprinting technique. But some of the browser properties has to released that are given same values and the properties that uncover the identity are simply disabled.

According to 2015 study, 90\% .onion sites are distinguishable from the regular sites. We will also be dealing with side channel attacks, side channel attacks are based on the information gained from the physical implementation rather than brute force or theoretical weakness. 

\section{Background and Related work}
\section*{Background}
Krishnamurthy and Wills on their paper, Privacy Diffusion on the web[2] have done a longitudinal study where they have shown that tracking on the web have steadily increased and more an more techniques are formed in the coming years which implies there should be more study done on the area of privacy.

Privacy techniques has quite evolved in the past 10 years. Ten years back, for tracking the users HTTP cookies were used then it went towards Flash cookies. With the evolution of web and introduction of HTML5 the trackers or the third party advertisers started using HTML5 storage such as localStorage, sessionStorage, indexedDB and ETag for tracking users. But the limitation with the HTTP cookie user delete cookies within 30 days. 

With the advancement of web tracking third party trackers and advertisers started focusing on browser fingerprinting. Browser fingerprinting is one of most used way of tracking user's nowadays. Many of the API such as battery API, network API, WebGL, Canvas, browser properties, plugins and many other propeties are being used for uniquely identifying the users. Beyond that there are even some research where the login leaks can identify which social network the users are currently logged in. Nowadays extensions and adds on have become a part of web browser, by loading the URI schema and event handlers we can make user profile which make the advertiser know which extensions are being used by a user.

Many of the browser fingerprinting techniques such as canvas fingerprinting, font and plugin enumeration, extension detection and other tracking issues which are still prevalent in browsers such as Mozilla, chrome etc. But these issues have defense in the case of tor browser.  the Some of side channels attacks and some other fingerprinting techniques such as os fingerprinting using math function, getClientRects fingerprinting and audio fingerprinting are still present. Canvas Fingerprinting[1] which one of the major fingerprinting techniques which is been used by big companies has defense technique with Tor Browser but  it doesn't automatically deny canvas Fingerprinting or block it. It gives a prompt or user a access to whether allow it or not.

\section{Design and Model foI for Tor Browser}
Tor browser is based on Mozilla Extended Support Release(ESR) Firefox branch. But there are many patches been applied to enhance the security and privacy. Some of the famous security features include HTTPS everywhere, which automatically switches thousands of sites from HTTP to HTTPS. Many of the patches are even done in Firefox and even the Tor browser features is augmented through the Tor browser extension. As a part of protection against Tor Exit Node eavesdroping, they have used HTTPS-Everywhere and to provide optional defense against javascript they have user NoSript and even they have made many modification in several of Firefox settings.

Privacy requirements help in reducing the privacy risk and ability of user's activity of one website to be linked with the user's activity of the another website without any knowledge of the user. 

 - Cross-Origin Identifier Unlinkability :  
Users activity must not be linked from one origin by any other origin without user interation and approval. This is mainly due to authentication tokens, browser identifiers and shared state.

 - Cross-Origin Fingerprinting Unlinkability : Users activity must not be linked from one origin to another origin by any of the third party from fingerprinting browser behaviour

 - Long-Term Unlinkability : browser should clear all its linkable state such authentication tokens and browser state and obtain a fresh identity.
 
Tor browser is not using any addons such as Addblock Plus, Ghostery, Priv3 which are actually avoided because they believe these are not going to ensure any privacy protection, Tor believe the development should be in general solution. (Give the dom change paper xhound) One of the research which happened in recent years showed that both extension and addons usage can be another fingerprinting vector as they can identifed using chrom URI and they produce change in the DOM which can lead us to easily who which extension they are using.  

There are 3 diffginerent security level in Tor browser - high, medium and low. In High Javascript is disabled by default. In some sites Javascript is enabled performance optimizations are disabled. Scripts on some sites may run slower.HTML5 video and audio media become click to play via NoScript. Some mechanism of displaying math equations, some font rendering features, some  types of images are disabled. In medium, same things are implied but Javascript is only disabled in non-HTTPS sites. Low level is most usable level in Tor browser. It doesn't block Javascript. 

In Torbrowser the Firefox proxy settings use Tor directly as a SOCKS proxy. To prevent WebRTC at the compile time it is disabled. All the plugins such as flash are disabled in Tor browser. Firefox addons can perform arbitary activity including bypassing Tor, that is reason there is addons whitelist. It doesn't even load any system wide extensions. Tor browser have all information written inside the bundle directory. Tor even disables third party cookies and all the cache enteries are isolated from URL bar domain. 

Operating system fingerprinting is not considered a big problem in privacy even though tor browser has reduced the entropy of finding the os to 2 bits. At least 3 HTML5 API Battery API, the Network Connection API and sensor API are disabled in the current browser because of fingerprinting. Even the mozilla services are disabled in Tor to make non of the mozilla services are contacted. Some of the feature in javascript functions like readers view and connection state has been disabled.

% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the

\section*{Related Work}
KUL Work needs to be added, and some side channel attacks

\section*{Previous findings}
We were looking to into bugtraq of Tor browser we were able to find different ways of fingerprinting Tor browser. Some of the Javascript API which were responsible for fingerprinting were removed from the Tor browser but inspite of that there are some API which is needed for the proper functioning of website. For example Math in Javascript, which is an important function in the case of web which will be used by many developers. With the help of Math one can do OS fingerprinting. If the value of Math.tan(-1e300) is -1.4214488238747245 then the os it is Linux machine and if the value is then -4.987183803371025 then it is Windows machine.

% biography section
% 
% If you have an EPS/PDF photo (graphicx package needed) extra braces are
% needed around the contents of the optional argument to biography to prevent
% the LaTeX parser from getting confused when it sees the complicated
% \includegraphics command within an optional argument. (You could create
% your own custom macro containing the \includegraphics command to make things
% simpler here.)
%\begin{biography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{mshell}}]{Michael Shell}
% or if you just want to reserve a space for a photo:

\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{picture}}]{John Doe}
\blindtext
\end{IEEEbiography}

% You can push biographies down or up by placing
% a \vfill before or after them. The appropriate
% use of \vfill depends on what kind of text is
% on the last page and whether or not the columns
% are being equalized.

%\vfill

% Can be used to pull up biographies so that the bottom of the last one
% is flush with the other column.
